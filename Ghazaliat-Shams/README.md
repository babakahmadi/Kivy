It's my first app and also it's very very very ... Naive :)
Not only I like it but also I LOVE it.

some prerequisities:
  1- it needs a ttf font file 'BNAZANIN.TTF' and it can be downloaded very easy by searching in google.
  2- it needs 'bidi' to be installed ( you can install it by 'pip install bidi')
  3- your kivy must be 1.8 or newer
  4- you need to compile with 'kivy -O main.py'

thanks :)
